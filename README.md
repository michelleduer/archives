*Included here are old projects or study that I put aside 
due to other programming priorities.

  * Studying up on PHP -- hope to return to this in the future.

**City-Aide** (2014)
  * A final project done for Harvard CS50x, an introductory course taken 
to see if I wanted to pursue programming further. Mainly C, with introduction
to Javascript, HTML, CSS.
